# Python for Data Engineering

A hands-on collection of **Jupyter notebooks** that build a solid foundation in Python with a **data engineering focus**.  
Each notebook is crafted to introduce, explain, and demonstrate key Python concepts and libraries essential for working with data at scale.

## Repository Structure

| Notebook | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **1. Core Syntax** | Covers Python fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and classes. Helps you write clean, modular, and reusable code. |
| **2. Data Structures** | Introduces Python’s built-in data structures — lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets — and their use in handling structured/unstructured data. |
| **3. File Handling** | Teaches reading/writing common file formats used in data pipelines (CSV, JSON, Parquet) and managing environment variables securely. |
| **4. Data Libraries** | Practical guide to core data libraries — **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **PyArrow**, and **Polars** — with examples of efficient data processing and transformation. |
